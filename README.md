# Z_ORM

I didn't purpose this project to be a production-ready version and it might miss out the design and other features, and also in development mode.

Z_ORM is a mini ORM framework inspired from hibernate and JPA.

It supports flexibility and easy to use for developers who want to touch the database. It supports in all systems written in Java. Unlike any other ORM framework, Z_ORM does not rely on JPA (Java Persistence API) so that fact might be both disadvantages also advantages.

### Features
<ul>
  <li>Support any kind of relational databases</li>
  <li>Easy to configure</li>
</ul>
